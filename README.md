TwentyFiveFive
==============

Break my workday into pieces, this is my last resort.


### Install dependencies:

Terminal notifier: https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier (must have ruby installed)

sqlalchemy: run `pip install sqlalchemy`

### Usage

`./twentyfivefive.py listen` to receive pings

`./twentyfivefive.py report` to view a report for todays accomplishments

`./twentyfivefive.py report YYYY-MM-DD` to view the accomplishments for any date

### TODO:

- Set up a setup file to resolve dependencies. Can we also resolve the ruby dependencies?
